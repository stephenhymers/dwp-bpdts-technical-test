## DWP BPDTS Technical Test Stephen Onions-Hymers

I have used the alphagov frontend project as a template to speed up development.

### Project set up

```git clone git@github.com:stephenhymers/dwp-bpdts-technical-test.git```

```npm install```

```npm start```


### App start page
http://localhost:3000 or <http://localhost:3000/full-page-examples/distance-from-london >

### Description

I have created a page where you can enter a number of miles and you will then be taken to a
page where you cna see users within that mile range, you can also view all users as a secondary
option.

### Code

The code I have written is within the following folder:

```app/views/full-page-examples/distance-from-london```
